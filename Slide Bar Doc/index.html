        <p>Infographics remain a popular way to visualize data and to use as part of your link building strategy (assuming, of course, that the data that you are visualizing tells a great story), but without access to a graphic designer, it is not always easy to design a visually appealing graphic.<//p>

<p>And that's where Piktochart comes in.</p>

        <article>
        <p>Screenshots and screen recordings are the perfect way to help your audience understand what you are trying to show them in "how-to guides" and the like.</p>

<p>But capturing these, especially if you don't want to have to edit them before using in your content, isn't always the easiest thing to do.</p>

<p>We love the Nimbus Chrome extension to capture both screenshots and recordings without hassle, and we are pretty sure you will grow to love it, too! </p>

     <p>Images and photos can really help to make your blog content more engaging, and the reality is that not every marketer has access to a team who can take custom photos. While some have the luxury of a stock photo library at their disposal, not everyone does.</p>

<p>When you need a license-free image to use in your content, Unsplash's library contains, as they claim, photos for everyone, something that we can confirm to be true! </p>
